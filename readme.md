## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

* **Database Setup:** Design and build a relational database (`library_db`) with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issue records, and return records.
* **CRUD Operations:** Implement `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to manage library data efficiently.
* **CTAS (Create Table As Select):** Use CTAS to generate new tables dynamically from existing data queries.
* **Advanced SQL Queries:** Write complex queries to extract insightsâ€”such as most borrowed books, active members, and branch performance.

## ðŸ§© Skills Demonstrated

* Database design and normalization
* SQL joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions
* Data manipulation and reporting
* Real-world query optimization
